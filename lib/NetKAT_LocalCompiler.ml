     fold over the [t]. Leaf nodes emit a single rule flowtable that mach all
     packets and perform the action represented by the [Action.t] at the leaf.

     Branch nodes convert the variable [v] to a function [guard] that modifies a
     pattern to check for the condition represented by that [v]. The [guard]
     function is then mapped across the flowtable generated from the true branch
     of the node. That result, together with the flowtable for the false branch
     are appended to produce the flowtable at that node.

     No additional guarding is necessary to ensure that no unintended packets
     hit the flowtable for the false branch. All flowtables generated by this
     algorithm will forward or drop all packets; they will not allow any packets
     to fall through. This is true in the base case of a leaf node. Inductively,
     this is also holds for the true and false tables of a branch node. Guarding
     the true table with the pattern represented by [v] means that it will match
     all packets that satisfy [v]. The false branch will therefore only apply to
     packets that don't satisfy [v]. Appending the guarded true table and the
     unguarded false tables will produce a table that will match all packets. *)
