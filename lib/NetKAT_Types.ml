(** {2 Packets} 

  If we only defined the semantics and were not building a system, a
  packet would only be a record of headers. However, the runtime needs to
  apply [eval] to packets contained in [PACKET_IN] mesages. For the runtime,
  packets also carry a payload that is unmodified by [eval]. *)

module HeaderMap = Map.Make (struct
  type t = header
  let compare = Pervasives.compare
end)
  
type header_val_map = header_val HeaderMap.t
    
(** Evaluating the policy [Test (h, v)] looks for [h] in these headers. If
    they are not found, we signal an error. An OpenFlow switch will never
    look for a header that does not exist. So, it is safe to assume that
    unused headers are set to zero or some other default value. *)

  (* First compare by headers, then payload. The payload comparison is a
     little questionable. However, this is safe to use in eval, since
     all output packets have the same payload as the input packet. *)
